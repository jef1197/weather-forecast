# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This is the Module 6 Challenge for the boot camp. The code was made from scratch to allow the user to be able to search for a city and display its forecast. It will allow the user to search for a city and view its current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast. The website will also save the users recent searches to allow the user to go back and view the weather without having the need to search for the city.
